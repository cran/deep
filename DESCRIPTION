Description: Explore neural networks in a layer oriented way, the framework
    is intended to give the user total control of the
    internals of a net without much effort. Use classes like PerceptronLayer
    to create a layer of Percetron neurons, and specify how many you want. The
    package does all the tricky stuff internally leaving you focused in what
    you want. I wrote this package during a neural networks course to help me
    with the problem set.
